    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        "Onigiri" is the Japanese word for rice ball.
        It consists of rice with a filling wrapped in roasted seaweed sheets.
        It's easy to make and delicious to eat.
        The extra bonus is that it's a small and portable meal!
    </p>
    <p>
        This variation consists of canned tuna mixed with Japanese mayonnaise.
        The most famous brand of Japanese mayonnaise is "Kewpie," which can be found in most Asian grocery stores these days.
        There's many other filings to try, so if you like this one, be sure to explore the myriad other options!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice, short grain</li>
        <li>Canned tuna, drained</li>
        <li>Japanese mayonnaise (e.g. Kewpie)</li>
        <li>Roasted seaweed sheet</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the white rice (I recommend a rice cooker for convenience)</li>
        <li>Scoop out 1 cup of hot white rice and allow it to cool</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooling, drain the canned tuna well and add the Kewpie mayo, then mix to combine</li>
        <li>Season the tuna mayo with salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>For easy cleanup, lay down plastic cling film and spread the rice into two piles</li>
        <li>Place a small amount of filling onto one of the rice piles, making sure not to pack so much that it would not be fully enclosed by the rice</li>
        <li>
            Gently wet your hands with water and add a bit of salt, then cover the rice with filling with the remaining rice.
            Pick everything up and form into a wedge shape, making sure to squeeze gently to compress the rice ball and get it to stick</li>
        <li>Cut a sheet of roasted seaweed to size and wrap the rice ball with it</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
